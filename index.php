				The purpose of this document is to provide instructions and explanation for the speedrun of Dragon Warrior IV for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  This route guide is based on the author's opinions of the best way to complete the game as quickly as viably possible, as of the time the guide was written or last revised, based on statistics and facts gathered through research and experimentation.  Aggressive strategies capable of competing with the top leaderboard times will be the primary focus, with alternate safety strats that are more viable for beginners and "no reset runs" mentioned where applicable.<br>
				<br>
				It will be assumed that the runner using this guide is relatively familiar with the game, insofar as being able to navigate the world map, towns, and dungeons, and knowing generally where the required items and plot triggers are.  Focus will instead be placed on movement, menu, and combat optimization.  A new runner who has only completed the game once or twice may need to seek out external resources for dungeon maps or item locations.  Refer to the appendicies for some recommended web sites that host such resources.<br>
				<br>
				This guide is designed to have three layers of detail.  By default, this web page will only show a high-level outline of everything that needs to be done, including items to be collected.  If you click a bullet point, it will expand to elaborate on the point, providing details such as combat advice and explanations of items you collect or purchase.  This second layer may also include alternative routing options or commentary from the author.  A third layer of detail will be delivered in the form of tooltips that display upon hovering over highlighted words and phrases, generally containing semi-useless statistics that may be interesting to learn, but won't necessarily affect the routing or the player's decision-making.
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="commentary">
				If you've used this guide to learn the route, I'd love to hear what you thought of it.  Specifically, whether or not you thought the finished product actually fit the description of intent given above.  If you have any questions or feedback, you can contact me at TheCowness on Discord, Twitter or Twitch.

			<h3>How to Read This Guide</h3>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="step col-sm-12">These plain-text bullets will contain very basic instructions on what you need to do to complete the run.  If you click them, details will expand below.  Bullets and detail boxes may also contain <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Tooltips will generally contain in-depth details that aren't neccesarily helpful to someone attempting this speedrun, but may satisfy a reader's curiosity about a meaningless statistic or explain why the segment is routed the way it is.  Tooltips may also provide author commentary specific to a sentence in a detail box that doesn't pertain to the entire segment.">Tooltips (hover/tap here)</a> that provide deeper details or specific commentary.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="detail-container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="details">
				Yellow detail boxes will add more explanation for what you're doing and why.  To make it through your first run, you'll at minimum want to read these detail boxes, but the commentary and alternate strats (see below) can wait until you know what you're doing.
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="alt-strat">
				Green "alt-strat" boxes explain alternative options you might prefer over the main route.  They're often safer and slower strats, particularly strats with a higher consistency rate that you might use in a "no-reset" run, such as for a race or a marathon performance, or simply if you aren't targeting a world record time.  As long as this run is, you can incorporate several of these slower, but more consistent, strategies and still get a very respectable time in this game.
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="aggro-strat">
				Sort of the opposite of the above, the red "aggro strat" boxes will detail strategies that you should not use unless you're willing to reset the run over a small potential time save.  These are risky strats that are not recommended until you have a good grasp on the segment, or if your run has fallen behind already and you need to make up some time.
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="commentary">
				Blue commentary boxes can provide anything from trivia to anecdotes, and will rarely help you speedrun the game.  Where the tooltips might break down a target gold amount into an itemized list, commentary trivia usually lists statistics such as the odds of getting into a fight on a specific walk, which might be nice to know but ultimately won't affect any of your decisions.
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="todo">
				Finally, the light-colored "todo" boxes are basically notes to myself reminding me of things I want to research some day.  I went back and forth on to whether I wanted these to be visible, and ultimately decided to show them, because it gives the reader an idea of some places that small optimizations could still be made.

			<h3>Power On!</h3>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="step col-sm-12">Create your file in Adventure Log 1 using a short name, male hero, and Message Speed 1.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="detail-container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="details">
			There are a few factors in character creation that affect the timing of your run.<br>
			<br>
			Adventure Log 1 is obviously used because it's faster <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I typically just mash Start and A as fast as I can after resetting to get back into the game.">to select the first adventure log</a> if you have to reset the console and load a safety save.<br>
			<br>
			A one-character hero name is optimal, but using a slightly longer name doesn't add on too much time.  Any time the hero's name comes up in the field, you'll lose one frame per extra character, which adds up a bit with all of the treasure chests you open, items you use and buy, each of the hero's level ups, etc.  Fortunately, the hero's name is never mentioned in the first half of the game, and during combat (except level ups/item drops), all text is printed instantly instead of one character per frame, so no time is lost during combat. As a rough estimate, I'd say using a 4-5 character name costs you less than a minute, but it's a much more substantial time loss than the hero's gender.<br>
			<br>
			The hero's gender doesn't affect the run much, except for <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Celia tells you she's &quot;always thought of you as a little sister&quot; and costs you over 65 frames (one frame per 65 text characters, plus a few more frames to scroll each line of text).">one sentence of text</a> in the beginning of Chapter Five that doesn't show up if you're male.  The game has very few <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="There are a few messages such as &quot;Solo searched the ground beneath feet [sic]&quot; (whose feet?!) that just omit the pronoun instead of using a unisex pronoun.">gendered pronouns</a> in it, so you don't have to worry about the length of "he" vs "she".  In total, the time lost by picking a female hero over a male hero is estimated to be less than two seconds.<br>
			<br>
			"Message Speed" is better-described as "Battle Speed", because it doesn't affect the speed at which text is printed at all.  As you move from Message Speed 1 through Message Speed 7, the game adds an increasingly longer delay between messages displayed in battle.  On Message Speed 8, the game will stop completely and wait for you to press A before displaying the next message ("Manual Message Speed").  Without a turbo controller, if you mash A quickly enough, MS8 is still a little bit faster than MS1, but you probably don't want to mash A as quickly as possible for 6-8 straight hours.  Now that turbo controllers are allowed, MS8 is easily the fastest option (Battles are up to 5-10% faster), but without turbo, it really comes down to player preference.<br>
			<br>
			If you do want to use turbo, note that MS8 saves more time when you're running from fights than when you're fighting.  Use of a turbo controller would still put MS8 as faster than MS1 when fighting, but at a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I did some scripted timing with 6Hz mashing speeds, but a human focusing on mashing should be closer to 10Hz.">decent human mashing rate</a> you actually lose time fighting some battles on MS8 over MS1.  You might consider switching message speeds (press Select during combat) to MS1 after picking up the Sword of Malice in Chapter One, and swapping back to MS8 after reaching Frenor in Chapter Two.  That's the longest section of the run where you're fighting (almost) every battle you encounter.

			Dragon Warrior IV uses "Game Start to Last Input" timing, so we don't run the timer while creating our character.  Start your timer as you press A to either select your message speed, or to load an existing <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Meaning, a file that starts with the king talking to Ragnar.  Obviously, you cannot tamper with the savefile or start from a file that saved at the church in Burland.">new game file</a>.  Note that while creating a new file each time you reset is both better practice <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Due to how long it takes to unload all of the menus that open up during file creation, it's actually half a second faster to start timing off of Continue a Quest versus the Message Speed screen.">and <i>technically</i> affects timing</a>, no ruling has been made against using an existing new game file, so assuming you don't make any safety saves, you don't have to re-create your file every time you reset in Chapter One.

			<div class="details">
				The scale shield is on F2 (third floor from the top) in the central section; you can't miss it.  The Sword of Malice is in the NW corner of the ground floor.<br>
				<br>
				The top two floors of this tower have easier enemies than down below, so don't worry about health too much.  Ducksbills' Sap is really the biggest concern up here.<br>
				<br>
				The bottom two floors are a bit more dangerous.  Without the scale shield, you can get hit for up to 9 damage (7 damage with it) by Pixies, Giant Bantams, and Lilypas.  Giant Bantams also have a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="1/2 chance to use SleepHit, 1/3 chance for it to put you to sleep.">1/6 chance</a> to put you to sleep when they attack.  I recommend keeping your combined HP above 40 on these floors.  For safety, you can equip the Scale Shield as soon as you pick it up.<br>
				<br>
				Remember that your inventory should be full after you pick up the Flying Shoes, so you need to use at least one herb by the time you open the Scale Shield chest, and at least two before the Sword of Malice chest.  Don't be afraid to use one or two extras, but save at least one (ideally two) to heal before the boss.<br>
				<br>
				You can also let Healie heal you before running, if you need to.  Keep in mind that Lilypas and Pixies will sometimes waste one turn each casting Upper and SpeedUp, respectively, but also keep in mind that Pixies will almost always outrun Healie after casting SpeedUp.  Additionally, if you run into one or two Ozwargs, parrying can be a good idea whether you need Healie to heal you or not, because getting targetted with two Icebolts averages 26 of Ragnar's 27 HP.  After they burn their spells, feel free to parry again to let Healie do his thing, because an Ozwarg's physical attack is useless.

				For this grind, you want to walk between the Sword of Malice room and the main room, using the top tiles, similar to the Healie deathwarp.  You're hoping to encounter anything that isn't a Giant Bantam.  I run from groups of two Giant Bantams because of how much time and MP you lose if they put Ragnar to sleep, and occasionally from the Bantam/Lilypa/Healer/Healer fight as well.<br>
				<br>
				Using the Sword of Malice as an item will cast Firebal, but I never use this effect EXCEPT on the Healers in the Bantam/Lilypa/Healer/Healer formation.  Basically, anything that would die to two rounds of Firebals but not two rounds of sword hits has resistance to the spell, so the sword wins.  A double-upper'd Lilypa is maybe another exception, but it's about a 50/50 to kill a Lilypa with Firebal, and it's extra menuing versus just attacking.<br>
				<br>
				The general order to focus enemies in is: Healers > Ducksbill > Bantam > Lilypa > Pixie > Ozwarg.  Healers only show in the formation mentioned above and they'll heal the Bantam, so kill them first.  Ducksbill cast Sap which will double the damage you take, but they should die in one attack.  Giant Bantams can waste a ton of time if they put you to sleep, so they get priority over Lilypas even though Lilypas <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Unless they Upper themselves">should also die in one hit</a>.  Pixies generally take two hits to kill and tend to <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I say they waste a turn, but keep in mind this spell makes all enemy monsters significantly faster than Healie.">waste a turn on SpeedUp</a>, so leave them alone.  Ozwargs' Icebolt hurts, but they take two hits to kill so they're almost guaranteed to get it off, and after they do, they're useless.<br>
				<br>
				Once Healie drops to 6 MP, or one battle after hitting level 5, start heading toward the boss room, stopping at the healing tile along the way.  It's generally not any safer running in this dungeon than fighting, so you may as well get the rest of your level while walking to the boss room.  You should definitely not chance the double Giant Bantam fight, though, or you risk having to backtrack to heal again.  Use herbs on both characters before going downstairs to the boss, prioritizing Healie if he's at 17-23 HP.

				This fight is complicated, but since you're a Dragon Quest soldier, your flowchart is pretty simple. High-level overview:  You're going to <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I've toyed with killing the Shadow first to make the enraged eyeball safer, but eyeball first is definitely faster and safer overall.">attack the Giant Eyeball until it dies</a>, and then attack Saro's Shadow until <i>it</i> dies.  Since your agility is <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eyeball 20 agi > Healie 18 Agi > Shadow 16 Agi > Ragnar ~7 agi.  Ragnar CAN go first, but never count on it.">very low</a>, there's very little else you can do to influence the outcome of this fight, but I'll explain the mechanics you're dealing with anyway.<br>
				<br>
				First thing first, kill the Giant Eyeball by attacking it <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="hopefully">twice</a> with Ragnar.  The eyeball will enrage if it drops under 33% health (1-14), which causes it to heal to 30 HP and switch to a double <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Unconfirmed, but I believe it drops to 3 attack power and picks up the Ogrebasher's 10x damage 100% crit ability (enemy crits deal half damage: 3 * 10 / 2 = 15).">crit-or-miss</a> attack pattern, but there's little you can do to avoid it.  Two full physical attacks from Ragnar at level six should kill the Giant Eyeball, but it can parry to take half damage, which almost always knocks it into its transformation range.  If that's not bad enough, the eyeball will occasionally "cheat" and take half damage <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Think, the parry/fight glitch from DW3.  It's basically the same thing.  Healie can do something similar, but it's rare and works differently.  Healie decides at the start of the round and then again when he acts whether or not he's parrying, so sometimes at the start of the round he'll take full damage, and then parry on his turn and start taking half damage.">even though it attacked you</a>.  Because of this strange behavior, I'm uncertain about the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="On paper, it's a 29.4% chance of him using his turn to parry, but I don't know the chances of him deciding at the start of his turn to parry.  If it's another 29.4%, that would be about a 50% chance that he parries either at the start of the round or on his action, resulting in my observed roughly-50/50 chance of him parrying before Ragnar's turn.">probability</a> of the eyeball parrying, but it feels like a 50/50.  For bonus points, if he parries an excellent move from Ragnar on turn one, he should always enrage.  The eyeball's usual damage is seven, and his enraged crits hit for 14-15.<br>
				<br>
				The fight is usually over if the eyeball enrages, but if the Shadow is nice to you and you manage to swing for 30 damage (possible with good strength rolls), you might get out of it.  One possible strategy for dodging the transformation if the eyeball parries on the first turn is to use the Sword of Malice and hope for a low damage roll, but if it rolls 18 you'll probably enrage it anyway, and there's a 20% chance the eyeball resists the spell altogether.  In my opinion, you're better off swinging and hoping the eyeball defends again on turn two.<br>
				<br>
				While all this is going on, Saro's Shadow is the actual threat, and can still kill you once the eyeball is gone.  His <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="All enemies in DW4 have six slots for abilities.  Saro's Shadow uses them randomly, with an even 1/6 chance of picking each one.">six skills</a> are, ordered by threat level:  Attack, Attack, Firebal, Weak Breath, Weak Breath, Blaze.  His attacks will hit Healie for about 17-23 damage, and Healie won't heal himself until he falls under 17 HP, so you really don't want to see him hit Healie.  Firebal is good for 10-18 damage to both characters, the weak breath does 6-10 to both, and Blaze does 6-10 to one target.<br>
				<br>
				Generally, you're just going to attack the Shadow until one of you dies, but there are some situations where you'll want to parry for safety, such as after a Firebal knocks both you and Healie under 20 HP, hoping Healie heals himself and/or the Shadow attacks Ragnar.  If you have decent max HP you might also run into situations where you could consider using an herb on Healie, if Healie is at 17-23 HP.<br>
				<br>
				It's extremely unlikely (<a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="To increase the accuracy of this statement I need to either script the fight to experiment, or re-read the TAS notes for DW3 to remember how the rounding in turn order calculation works.  Assuming Ragnar has 7 agility, I calculated 1.9% based on infinitely-precise random number generation (but the NES always truncates decimals, and we're dealing with small numbers), and 5.4% based on an even distribution of possible initiative values for both combatants.">2-5% chance</a>) for Ragnar to go before the Shadow, so never ever count on it.  If Healie dies, assume Saro's Shadow will physical you for 20 damage every turn when deciding if you need to use an herb or not.  If you don't have extremely high HP (55+) this likely means you're doing the ol' Dragonlord "heal, fight, repeat" strats.  Ragnar's average max HP is 47 at level 6, but as long as you're not more than +/- 5 HP, his HP doesn't swing your odds of winning the fight too much.<br>

			Once you have a handle on the upcoming grind and the Chameleon Humanoid fight, you can consider selling Alena's Feather Hat for a Thorn Whip.  This will give her enough attack power to reliably one-shot most enemies in the grind, though the Humanoid fight will be a little more dangerous.  If you do sell the Feather Hat, buy a Wooden Hat for Alena once you reach Frenor (selling the Thorn Whip in addition to what you usually sell).  This actually makes the gold routing a lot easier, but you might take more damage in the tournament.<br>

			There are two encounter zones outside Santeem, so head straight north out of Serene to get to the second zone.  When you smack into the ocean, you're one step into the second zone.<br>
			<br>
			There are nine different enemies in this zone, and most of them aren't worth much XP.  The most common enemy formations will be a combination of 10-11 HP, 2-3 EXP enemies.  Your physical attacks from Alena are usually going to start out doing about 7-9 damage, and Cristo 6-8.  Brey's physical will do 0-2, and Icebolt does 10-16.  You don't really want to waste Icebolt, but don't be afraid to use it liberally; it only takes about ten seconds to use the inn in Tempe, and you can lose more time than that if you get into a big fight without any MP.<br>
			<br>
			In general, I have Brey Icebolt the weakest enemies for guaranteed kills, and Alena and Cristo double up on the stronger enemies.  There's a possibility that Alena can knock out a 10 HP enemy herself, but it's not really common enough to try it.  For example, if the fight is Gopher, Gopher, Worm, there's a chance Alena and Cristo could each kill one to make it a one round fight.  However, I generally just assume it's going to take two rounds, even at level 3, so I Icebolt the gopher and have A/C gang up on the worm, then have everyone attack the remaining gopher on turn two.<br>
			<br>
			You should always run from large groups of Kaskos Hoppers.  They're only worth 1 EXP, and they're very dangerous because they usually all attack the same target.  Minons always show up alone or in groups.  At low levels they're really slow to fight but they're worth good gold, so you can either take them or run, but once Brey learns Sap you can throw that at them to speed up the fight.  Troglodytes, I treat the same as the 11 HP enemies, having A/C gang up on them while Brey Icebolts something weaker, if applicable.<br>
			<br>
			The solo Rabidhound fight is straightforward, but in the Hound/Hopperx3 fight I usually Icebolt the hound twice while A/C fight the hoppers.  If Cristo's level 3 (if you think Cristo will definitely kill a hopper in one shot, and A/B/C together will kill the hound in the second round) you might Icebolt a hopper turn one to make turn two go a little faster.<br>
			<br>
			There are a couple items that can drop during this grind, most notably Wing of the Wyvern by Rabidhounds, which saves you 25 gold, and Leather Hats from the Elerats, which can be sold for 48 gold (The 2 defense isn't worth equipping it on Cristo/Brey).  The other enemies just drop herbs.

				Ideally the fight takes 4-5 rounds, but damage rolls, the Chameleon Humanoid's resistance to Icebolt, and the Chameleon Humanoid's SleepHit can mess things up a bit.  The general idea is to avoid knocking the Rabidhounds under 1/3 HP so that the Chameleon Humanoid doesn't heal, but if he does heal, he's not attacking you, so there's a silver lining there.  If Cristo gets killed or put to sleep before he casts Upper on Alena, you're probably going to lose the fight.  If Brey dies before casting Sap, the fight will be slow, but as long as Upper goes off you should survive.

				If your chapter one was slow, you can try to save a minute or so by trying to fight this boss without Upper, but <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I've never scripted this fight, but I've tried it about a dozen or so times in my own bad runs.">in my experience</a> you only have about a 30% success rate without it.  Grinding from Brey's third level to Cristo's fourth takes about two minutes, but you'll need to make up the missing gold and/or EXP after the boss, so you'll have to take an extra fight or two outside Frenor.<br>
				<br>
				Without Upper, the fight should look like this:<br>
				1) Attack Rabidhound A, Attack Rabidhound A, Icebolt Rabidhound A (Rabidhound A dies)<br>
				2) Attack Rabidhound B, Heal, Sap Chameleon Humanoid<br>
				3) Attack Rabidhound B, Heal, Icebolt Rabidhound B (Rabidhound B dies)<br>
				4) Attack Chameleon Humanoid, Heal or attack, Icebolt Chameleon Humanoid (repeat until Chameleon Humanoid dies)<br>
				<br>
				It sounds easy enough, but if anyone's killed or put to sleep, it's over.  Alternatively, you could try the same strat as with Upper, but have Cristo pre-emptively heal himself on turn one instead of casting Upper.  That strat's going to be slower if it succeeds, but might ultimately be safer.

				3) Attack Rabidhound B, Heal, Sap Chameleon Humanoid<br>
				4) Attack Chameleon Humanoid, Heal or attack, Icebolt Chameleon Humanoid (repeat until Chameleon Humanoid dies)<br>
				<br>
				Since Alena has significantly less defense, you need two Uppers on her.  If the Rabidhounds aren't killed from an Alena + Icebolt combo, repeat the previous turn.  The Chameleon Humanoid will heal them, so you'll take less damage on the following turn.  The setup is actually safer if the Chamaleon Humanoid heals Rabidhound A on turn two.

			<br>

	</div>
	<div class="detail-container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="details">
			First thing's first:  For your first couple of runs, you may not want to bother grinding on metal slimes.  An alternate grind strat (see below) will give you <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="In addition to being more stable, the alternate grinds aren't more than 5-10 minutes slower than an average metal slime grind.">more consistency</a> if you just want to complete a few runs.  However, Metal Slimes are the easiest strat to learn, in addition to being potentially the fastest.  The safer routes through the chapter will require you to learn all of the enemies in the chapter before you can get your time down low enough to not be losing much time vs a good metal slime grind, so if you want to jump into doing runs, it may be good to do a few metal slime runs first to get a feel for how much damage most of the enemies do, and what actions they can take.<br>
			<br>
			The "strategy" for this grind is to run outside of Endor to the hills and run from every enemy you encounter until you find a metal slime, at which point you will attack it three times and pray it dies.  After you kill the first one, cast Return to Endor (Brey will learn it), <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Ideally you save 24 gold for the Bazaar inn after the grind (Metal Slimes only drop 5 gold) but if Cristo has no MP, use the inn now.">use the inn if needed</a>, save the game, and resume the hunt.<br>
			<br>
			The metal slimes show up about 9.5%-10% of the time, and have a 50% chance to run.  With 50 agility, they will almost always go first, though after you kill the first one, Alena will have enough agility (18-22) to occasionally go first, but it won't happen often.  Additionally, Metal Slimes have a 50% chance of having either 3 HP or 4 HP when the fight begins, and each time you attack you have a 1/3 chance to deal one point of damage after your 1/64 chance of getting a critical hit (level/256 for Alena) fails.  All in all, the odds of killing a Metal Slime work out to about 14%, once encountered.<br>
			<br>
			As far as the other encounters here, you don't want to fight anything here, so all you're watching out for are formations where you want to reset the console immediately upon run failure instead of waiting to see if you survive, running again, <i>possibly not even succeeding</i> on the next run attempt, and then having to cast Heal up to three times outside of battle.  Example formations are:  4-5 Armor Scorpions, 4 Rogue Knights, anything with 2+ Pteranodons, formations of 6-8 Rogue Knights + Healers... When you fail to run in chapters 1-4, there's a 25% chance for each monster to not take any action at all, but when you're resetting, you shouldn't count on more than one enemy to not act.<br>
			<br>
			As for the enemies themselves, Scorpions deal decent damage and have a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="4.2%">chance</a> to get critical hits.  Rogue Knights have higher attack and a lower crit <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="1.85%, counting the chance to call for help.">chance</a>, but will waste turns calling for Healers.  Healers waste a lot of time tickling each other.  Skeletons usually show up in pairs with no backup and will always cast Defense on turns one and three, so if they don't kill you on turn two, you're fine.  Pteranodons and Razor Winds, you know from Birdsong Tower.<br>
			<br>
			After this grind, and all of your Lifeforce Nuts and Strength Seeds are used, you're going to want to have 80 HP and 42 strength (80 attack power) minimum, and the higher the better on both.  Two more strength makes a big difference, and if you have two <i>less</i>, you're going to want to consider grinding to level twelve, lest you need to rely on a critical hit on Roric or Sampson in the arena.<br>
			<br>
			If Brey survives both Metal Slime fights, you won't have much trouble leveling to 12 off normal encounters.  Do the other pre-tournament errands, including buying the Iron Claw, and then go outside the Bazaar to grind.  After Brey gets Snowstorm at level 11, move to Endor.  Cristo should cast Surround on Sandmasters, Armor Scorpions, and Rogue Knights.  Brey should cast Icebolt/Snowstorm on just about everything but Skeletons (use Sap instead).

			There are a couple different alternate strats for this grind floating around.  Some simply fight every encounter in this chapter, and some do a hybrid of killing metal slimes and grinding on other enemies.  The next box will outline an old strat, but you may want to look around at more recent runs for more ideas.  I'm personally not a fan of any strat that kills off Brey, because it costs time later, especially if Mara dies in the lighthouse and doesn't learn Outside, but all of the alternate strats I've seen seem to be no more than 5-10 minutes slower than an average metal slime grind, so if you just want to get as decent of a time as you can get while consistently finishing runs, metal slimes may not be the right route to take.
			</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<div class="alt-strat">
			I'm <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I've only tried this grind a few times, and never really paid attention to other players as they were doing it.  Most of what I've written below is based on speculation after reviewing the enemies in each zone of the chapter, and not on practical/observational data.">not very practiced</a> on the alternate grind strats, but the general idea is that you keep Brey dead, buy the Iron Claw, beat up a few Grislysabers in Birdsong Tower, buy a Morning Star for Cristo, and then grind outside Endor.<br>
			<br>
			The reason you're going for Grislysabers is because they don't have spells, and they call for backup.  This means they'll only attack Alena if Brey is dead and Cristo is in the back of the party, so you can parry and stack Upper on her while they call for help.  Only one of their six attack slots is occupied by the Reinforcements skill, so you'll want to keep at least two of them alive.  They also have about a 1/24 chance to get a critical hit for about 35 damage, so keep Alena's HP high.<br>
			<br>
			Grislysabers are worth 30 XP and 46 Gold each.  Exactly 30 Grislysabers will get Alena to level 9 from level 6, and give you just enough gold to buy a Morning Star.  The Grislysabers can crit for about thirty damage, so I would recommend splitting the grind into two fights to get Alena some more HP for the back half.  After 16 kills, she should reach level 8, so stop here and go downstairs to the tower's inn before starting the next fight.  After 30 total kills, go to Endor, restock, buy the Morning Star, and go grind in the hills outside.<br>
			<br>
			You can fight just about everything out here, but run from anything with too many healers (3+?).  Rogue Knights and Armor Scorpions are vulnerable to Surround, so consider using it or Upper against large groups.  Surround has a chance to fail on the knights, so Upper may be better against them.  Don't bother casting Upper against Skeletons, as you should be able to take them down before they do any real damage.  The other two real enemies in this zone are Razor Winds and Pteranodons, which you know from Birdsong Tower.  Razor Winds are pushovers, but Pteranodons can do serious damage to Cristo with their Firebal spell, so prioritize taking them out first.<br>
			<br>
			After 1500 more EXP (~40 enemies) Alena should hit level 11.  The downside to this grind is that Brey isn't going to get any EXP, so you can't use him to power-level past 11 if your strength is bad and you need an extra level.  1100 EXP should get you to 12, so just keep grinding as you were.

			<div class="details">
			For the most part, you're going to just mash A until you either win or lose, but there are a couple subtleties with some of these enemies you need to keep track of.  Try not to use any herbs during the first three fights, but if you have to use one, you have to use one.  Also keep in mind fights 2-4 all drop herbs, so definitely don't end those fights with a full inventory.<br>
			<br>
			Hun is a pushover, but will hit you 2-4 times depending on your strength and agility.  Equip the Iron Claw if you haven't already, and attack him until he dies.  Use one herb after the fight unless you crit him immediately.  If that happens, use one against Roric, because he'll drop one.<br>
			<br>
			Roric is where your max HP comes into play.  Hopefully he'll die before you need to use an herb, but he's a bit faster than you, so you should assume he will go before you.  He should go down in five hits, but damage rolls and parrying can make it take more.  Since it's 1v1 combat, you want him to parry, but often he needs to parry twice for the free damage to allow you to avoid one of his attacks.  If you have to use an herb during this fight, you're probably going to need an early critical hit on Sampson to make it through.<br>
			<br>
			You'll probably use two herbs after this fight, but if you dodged an attack and you're over 60 HP after the first one, you can keep the other.<br>
			<br>
			There are two ways to fight Vivian.  The first strategy is to attack her until she dies.  Alternatively, you can parry once or twice so that she spends 8 MP before casting Healmore on turn three.  Either way, you take about the same amount of damage, but if she opens with Firebal, it'll be faster to parry once.  Note that when she's low on MP, she can fail to cast each of her spells <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Not positive about this, but I think if she fails a cast, she recognizes that spell and all of the more expensive spells can't be used anymore.  She can definitely fail Healmore, and then fail Firebal or Icebolt later.">one time</a>.<br>
			<br>
			After this fight, use herbs until you're within 15 HP of your max.  Sampson hits for about 20, so using an herb against him will only earn you 10-20 HP.<br>
			<br>
			Sampson is the fight where your attack power really matters.  His defense is so high that even 2 points of strength can shorten the fight by one round, which can let you conserve herbs for Linguar.  The main problem with Sampson is that he can, albeit rarely, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I'm not sure how much his herbs heal him for, presumably 30-40, but if it happens and you don't get a critical hit, you're dead.">heal himself</a> if he's under 50% HP, so before you've dealt over 45 points of damage, heal yourself to full and focus on attacking.  Usually he'll take 6-7 hits to kill, and your average damage will be somewhere in the 13-15 range.<br>
			<br>
			If you have any herbs left, use two.  Then, the last fight begins...<br>
			<br>
			Linguar is pure RNG.  When the fight begins and after every turn of the fight, he creates three illusions and hides among them.  There's no way to manipulate him, and he has an even 25% chance of landing in each slot.  It's always faster to attack A, so the only reason to attack a different target is if he builds up power.  After he builds up power, if he moves to a different slot, he loses the built up power, so you get to make a decision:  Do you want to trade with him, or is your HP low enough that you can't afford for him hit you for double damage?  Essentially, if you're above 40 HP (including unused herbs), attack the one that built up power.  Otherwise, attack any of the others.  If your attack power is high (84+), you might kill him in two hits, but most of the time, it takes three.

			You're going to be doing this process at least twice -- almost always three times -- so you'll get used to it quickly.  The goal here is to get 35,000 gold to buy a shop in Endor, which we can then use to print our own money, but on top of that we'll want to at least buy an Iron Shield to get the shop primed.  The more leftover money you have, the better, so don't be afraid to do this segment one more time if you have enough to buy the shop, but not enough to buy a shield.<br>
			<br>
			The shop works like this:  Every time you sell something to him, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sometimes referred to as a &quot;critical hit&quot;.">it rolls a 1/32 chance</a>.  If that hits, the old man will offer you a random value between 150% and 200% of the item's price (the price you would pay to buy it from a store).  If it misses, he will offer between 84% and 125% of the item's price.  For Iron Aprons, this means he'll usually offer 1265-1875 GP, but will sometimes offer 2250-3000 gold.  In terms of <i>profit</i>, these ranges are -235 to 375 GP, and 750-1500 GP.<br>

			You should need about 7000 gold to get through this segment, which is about what you'll average if you never accept anything under 1750 gold and never get an offer from the higher range.  It's fairly safe to put your cutoff at 1700 and assume you'll get one or two higher offers to raise your average profit enough to proceed.

			To finish this chapter, we need 60,000 gold, and <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The alternative is to keep using Neta, which costs you about five minutes.">the fastest way to do that</a> is to fulfill a sidequest for the King of Endor that requires us to buy seven Half Plate Armors and seven Broad Swords.<br>
			<br>
			To get the money for <i>that</i>, we're going to use our new shop.  Every day, you will spend as much gold as you can at the weapon shop, give all of your items (except the lunch she gives you; it's not worth it) to Neta, and then talk to her behind the counter to stay the night.<br>
			<br>
			Mechanically, each night, every item in Neta's inventory has a 75% chance to be sold for a random value between 150% and 200% of the normal purchasing price (the number she gives you is 150%).  You want her to sell everything she has so that your gold can continue to exponentially increase, so you should sleep more than once before collecting your money.  Reference the green cells on the chart below for how to get her to sell her entire inventory with 90% consistency.  Basically, you're going to stay two nights on the first cycle, and then stay three nights each cycle until the final cycle where you should stay a fourth night just to be sure she sells it all.<br>
			<br>
			Never sell or drop the lunch until you have enough gold for eight Abacus of Virtue (12800 GP).  An average sale of eight Abacus of Virtue nets you 9600 GP profit, so if you start the day with 16k GP you will likely hit the 24.6k mark after selling eight more Abacuses, so it's never really worth it to do 9-10 abacuses.  If you barely miss the mark, just sell another 7-8 abacusses, and you'll have some extra gold for chapter five.

Make sure you heal Orin if he starts the round with <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Balzack's average damage on Orin with a physical attack should be about 29-30, so he could technically kill Orin in two hits from 60, but it's unlikely.  64-66 would be 100% safe.">less than 60 HP</a>, and heal the back sister if she starts with <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Another Mara note, at level 3 her max will only be 23 on average, so I'm not sure if you lower the heal line and risk getting killed by his fireball attack, or what.">less than 20.</a>  Finally, note that Balzack regenerates about twenty HP per turn, which is barely less than Orin's damage output, so any damage the sisters can safely contribute will really speed the fight along.

			When you walk through the cave between Branca and Endor, there's a 1/32 chance that you'll be given two thousand casino coins as you pass in front of the guard.  If this happens, you can use them to buy a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="You can afford a second Wizard Ring, but it's not worth the inventory space.">Wizard Ring and Staff of Jubilation</a> at the casino when you pick up Mara.  Both of these items are primarily for safety in the Lighthouse, but the Ring can also help later on if you cut the Hat of Happiness.  The Staff of Jubilation will go to Mara, who can equip it for decent damage, but on top of that, she'll use it in battle to stun enemies, including the Flamers and Lighthouse Bengal, which gives her something useful to do if she's not healing.  Its use effect operates on the same resistance value as Sleep, so it can technically affect Esturk as well, but it's not really worth another character's turn (Hero or Cristo?) in that battle.<br>
			<br>
			Unfortunately, nothing in the casino sells for anything (Staff of Jubilation sells for like seven gold, Magic Potion for 22, and everything else is unsellable), so these are the only items worth considering.  An interesting theory would be to gamble the coins into a Meteorite Armband for the Hero, which would be very helpful once you get the Aeolus Shield, but I'm not sure how much time that's worth.  Two to three minutes at the very most.

This is exactly why we bought those herbs, despite learning Healmore at level 5.

			This fight is pretty straightforward because the Vampire Bats can't hurt you, and the Urchins only have three points of agility.  At level five, unless you got extremely unlucky agility rolls, you should almost always outrun them, which allows you to wait until you're pretty low to heal.<br>
			<br>
			The Urchins will always die in two attacks (unless they dodge), and will only do 6-10 damage each per turn.  They can also build up power, so keep in mind their next attack (or breath) will deal double damage if they do that, but what that ability really means is that there's a chance they'll die after building up and you won't take any damage at all.<br>
			<br>
			After the Urchins are down, unless you killed a Metal Slime earlier, try casting Expel on the Bats.  It's got a decent chance to hit at least one of them.  The bats will usually take two physical hits to kill if you didn't kill a Metal Slime, or one if you did.<br>
			<br>
			This fight gives a ton of EXP to help the Hero catch up in levels.  You should learn Return at level 7, but probably won't have the MP to cast it right away.

			Once you win a battle with Hector in your team, your Fairy Water will recognize your party's highest character level as 202, allowing you to repel all overworld enemies.  This happens because Hector's stats are pulled from the monster data table, and he is the 202nd "monster" in the table.  The game recognizes this index as his level, and uses it to determine how fairy water should work, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I'm told the casino uses the remainder of your party level divided by 128, but I haven't tested this myself and I'm not sure it would matter; Hector would count as level 74.">as well as which enemy groups should appear in the casino monster arena</a>.</a><br>

			After recruiting Hector, walk straight east.  This will keep you in the inn's encounter zone.  The desert zone is full of Rogue Knights and other tough enemies, so you don't want to fight down there if you can help it.  You need to turn south by the time you become adjacent to the mountain ridge north of you.  If you take extra steps to force a fight in the northern zone, your fairy water will wear off before Konenbur.  If you don't get into a fight, I recommend continuing south into the desert anyway, and hoping for an easy fight or a Metal Slime.  If a Metal Slime flees from you, the Fairy Water trick will still be activated.

			You're going to want to run from everything in here, unless you take a chance on a Metal Slime.  If you die to the boss, you lose any EXP you gained along the way, so it's not worth fighting other enemies, even the Rogue Wispers who generally won't hurt you.  If you lose anyone during the climb, you'll want to reset the console, unless you've killed a Metal Slime.  You have enough gold to revive after one wipe, and the EXP from a single Metal Slime can really improve your chances of surviving the boss by giving everyone more HP, and Nara more MP.<br>
			<br>
			Metal Slimes show up everywhere in the tower.  On the bottom two floors they're very common, but rarely show up alone.  Your teammates will not attack the Metal Slimes until the other enemies are dead, so keep that in mind when deciding if you want to fight on the botton two floors.  Furthermore, unless you go to Use No MP, Nara and Mara will cast spells on the Metal Slimes.  On the next two floors the slimes are rarer, but always show up solo, similar to the Endor grind.  Switch to Use No MP and fight them whenever you see them solo.  The boss floor has no random encounters.<br>
			<br>
			Make sure you grab the Fire of Serenity on the fourth floor; it's the chest in the center of the open room.  There's a Golden Barette on the top floor of the lighthouse, but it's not very useful.  It gives 4 defense power over the Feather Hats and 6 over the Wooden Hat, but it's not worth picking up unless you've sold a Feather Hat or need the 405 gold for whatever reason.<br>

			Before you begin the boss fight, heal up and make sure Mara has all of your herbs.  Ideally, Hero and Nara each have at least 15 MP, and Mara has two or more herbs.  You probably won't live long enough to use more than that...

			The Lighthouse Bengal actually isn't who you're worried about here.  Sometimes he'll try to stun your team, but as long as Hero and Nara aren't hit by it, he's just wasting his own turn.  He does have the possibility to cast Heal up to three times, but this isn't really an issue either because you'll be Expelling the Flamers and Nara will put him to sleep.<br>
			<br>
			The Flamers are the big problems here, and their stats speak for themselves.  They have more attack power than the Bengal, they're faster, and they can cast Firebal twice.  This fight can get real nasty if both Flamers open with Firebal.  To win this fight, you need to cast Expel on at least one of the Flamers and get the other two targets to sleep (or, ideally, Expelled).<br>

			Set your Tactic to Offensive for this battle.<br>
			On turn one, Expel Flamer B.  This has about a 42% chance to work.  Nara  will cast Sleep on Flamer A, which has about an 83% chance to work.  Mara will use an herb or cast Blaze/Firebal.  Hector will do Hector.<br>
			Continue Expelling Flamer B until it works, you wipe, or Nara puts Flamer B to sleep (switch to Flamer A).  Try to Expel both Flamers unless Hero runs out of MP, or the fight feels safe enough that you can win it with damage -- i.e. One Flamer is gone, the other is asleep and at half HP, and the Bengal is asleep or dead and unable to cast Heal.  Nara will unfortunately start casting Heal if you get slammed with Firebals, so hopefully Mara picks everyone up with herbs so that Nara is free to keep casting Sleep.  You can try to help healing if both Flamers are disabled, but you probably won't have the MP to do so.

			Ideally, Taloon, Nara, and Mara all die, and everyone else lives.  If anyone important dies, revive them before Keeleon.  If anyone unimportant live, kill them off before the Keeleon fight, so that they don't get EXP from him.  A good way to do this is to put the Hero in the party, stop using Fairy Water, and have Hero kill them off when you get into a fight.  If everyone somehow survives, consider using the random encounters in the Zenithian Armor cave.

When you use it in battle, it will cast Sleepmore, but this effect goes through the usual Sleep resistance, so it's not any more useful than casting the actual spell.  The Sacred Robe gives Cristo a 1/3 resistance to spell damage, which is good to have for most of the remaining bosses in this chapter.<br>

			If you have extra gold (extra small medal, extra iron aprons) you can buy a Dragon Mail for Hero for a good defense boost and 1/3 resistance to breath attacks, but if you're getting the Zenithian Armor before the Metal Babble grind, it may not be worth the investment.

			<div class="details">
			This fight, and most Chapter Five boss fights, are pretty simple after you've set up.  You're only controlling one character during the battle, and our pre-battle prep and selected tactic will determine what the other three characters do.<br>
			<br>
			The Hero is essentially just going to attack Keeleon to keep him asleep, but if you're feeling bold you can use the Staff of Punishment for 25-55 damage when he's asleep to increase your damage output.  However, Keeleon is much faster than your team, so if you attack on a turn he wakes up, there's a good chance you'll put him right back to sleep.  Hero can also serve as the healer, if you've got Keeleon asleep and want to heal one or two people, but since Keeleon is regenerating, you don't want to spend too many turns healing.<br>
			<br>
			Panon will unfortunately ignore your party tactics, so it's hard to say what he'll do.  Hopefully he'll just attack, as he also has a Sword of Lethargy and can help the Hero put him to sleep, but he can also waste turns casting Sleep or using RobDance.  Panon has high HP and a Cloak of Evasion to help him dodge physical attacks, so that's why he's in the lead.<br>
			<br>
			Alena will attack at the start of the fight, but after Keeleon takes a little damage she'll switch to using the Staff of Punishment, which will do more damage.  If she falls to low HP, she may start defending every turn, so you'll need to heal her as soon as Keeleon goes to sleep.  If you left herbs on her after chapter two, she may use them when someone gets low, which can be annoying if she would otherwise be using the Staff.<br>
			<br>
			Cristo needs to stay on Use No MP because he doesn't have any useful spells.  He can cast Heal or Upper, but he's got the highest damage output on the team with that Sword of Miracles, so neither spell is worth him stopping.  Cristo has the lowest HP of the group by far, but his Sacred Robe will cut Firebal's damage, and his Sword of Miracles will heal him.<br>
			<br>
			Keeleon will probably kill you if he doesn't go to sleep in the first 3-4 rounds, but if he does, just reset the console and walk back.

			This fight is basically the same as the Keeleon fight, with the key difference that you're much faster than Balzack.  This means the Hero is free to heal or use the Staff of Punishment when Balzack is asleep, though at this point the Staff's average damage isn't really better than the Hero's attacks.  Balzack also regenerates more HP than Keeleon, so you should be careful not to lag behind on damage.  If anyone dies early on in the fight, just reset the console.

			This is risky, but you can grab the Zenithian Armor now if you want.  If you want the Zenithian Armor <i>and</i> Hat of Happiness, you'll need to grab two small medals out of Haville before going for the armor.  The only real payoff of this is that Hero will take reduced damage from Bebanbars' Firebane in the Metal Babble grind.  The Hat of Happiness sounds useful for the Metal Babble grind, but realistically while you're walking between partitions you find so many encounters per step that once you get there, you'll only be gaining maybe 1 MP per battle.<br>
			<br>
			If you really want to yolo this, you can hand in Panon for the Zenithian Helmet and commit to not dying or fighting anything between here and Lucia.  If you save and reset after giving up Panon, you'll get about three overworld/sea encounters on the way to the Zenithian Armor cave, one on the way to the Royal Crypt, and three more between the Colossus and Dire Palace, which can be very dangerous.

			Cast Repel before entering this dungeon.<br>
			<br>
			The big problem you're facing in the Colossus is Blizags, which have a tendency to cast Beat and Defeat.  They're not likely to successfully cast and land the spells, but they appear on every floor so over the course of the dungeon it becomes pretty likely you'll lose a couple people.  You will also rarely encounter Snowjives, which cast Blizzard, the tier-three ice elemental group spell.  Both monsters are highly resistant or immune to Beat/Defeat, Expel, and Stopspell, so there's not a whole lot you can do but run.  If they're solo you can fight them, but then you'll lose the repel bug when you exit the dungeon.<br>
			<br>
			The Demon Hammer is in the Colossus on the left hand (your right, stage left), barely out of your way.  If you die after collecting it, it's recommended to just go grind babbles and come back later.  However, the Aeolus Shield does help in the grind, so you want to try for it if you have 3+ party members alive when you reach the Hammer.<br>
			<br>
			Once you jump out of the colossus, you can regain your wagon by re-entering and exiting the dungeon, but if the Hero's alive to cast Return, there's no reason to do this.  If the Hero is dead, grab the wagon so that Brey can cast Return, and hopefully you cast Repel before entering the tower (or at least before the Hero died).<br>
			<br>
			Inside the Dire Palace, go all the way to the back and grab the Small Medal and Aeolus Shield from the hidden basement.  Make sure the Hero has the Shield (don't equip it).  Then, Return to Endor and head into the Crypt.

			<br>
			Upon entering the Crypt, head straight down to the bottom floor.  If you kill a Metal Babble on the top floor, that's awesome, because it gives Brey the EXP he needs to learn Bikill, but don't grind for it.  Along the way, grab the Small Medal chest.<br>
			<br>
			When you get to the bottom floor, walk all the way around and get to the staircase leading up.  Walk in and out of this room to look for Metal Babbles.  If you run out of resources, head upstairs and use the healing tile to restore your HP and MP.  It will not revive, so keep everyone alive until Cristo learns Vivify.  Keep your health maxed out until you've killed 2-3, after which point you can loosen up a bit, but try to keep everyone above 100 HP (Cristo can be a little lower).<br>
			<br>
			You're going to run from most of the enemies in here, but if you get large groups of certain enemies, Expel or the Aeolus Shield are better options.  The only enemy you should Expel is the Dragonit, who is 100% vulnerable to it.  The shield and Defeat work great (83% chance) on Bebanbars, Hambalbas, and Tyranobats.  Most enemies in here are worth 1.5-2% of a Metal Babble, so don't fight anything for the EXP.  If you want safety EXP, just grind another Babble.<br>
			<br>
			On that note, depending on how safe you want to be, you can kill anywhere between eight and ten Metal Babbles.  Eight will get Zap for the Hero, nine will get HealAll for Cristo, and ten will get HealAll for Hero.  HealAll is nice for the walk down to Esturk, because you'll save time over casting 2-3 Healmores to get Alena and Ragnar to full, but doesn't really help with safety or stability.

			Once inside the tower, re-equip the Sword of Lethargy.  Proceed through the dungeon to Zenithia Castle.  Vivify anyone who's dead before entering the castle, but don't use magic to top off your HP.  If you cut the Hat of Happiness, consider returning to Soretta to heal if you spent too much MP in the tower.<br>
			<br>
			Inside Zenithia, you can optionally talk to Master Dragon to get about half a level up worth of EXP for the Hero.  This also powers up the Zenithian Sword, doubling its attack power and activating its ability to remove buffs from enemies.  The attack boost is only useful if you want to be really aggressive against Necrosaro, and the ability is only useful if his third phase stacks Increase.  You should also grab a Dew of the World Tree from the minidemon who's growing World Trees.  Use it immediately to refill your health, and talk to him again to get another one.  Note that walking around Zenithia will also give Cristo a chance to regenerate MP if he has the Hat of Happiness.<br>
			<br>
			Jump into the hole to get to the Final Cave.  Re-order the party to just Hero and Ragnar, and proceed through the cave.  Once you get <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A room or two before you reach the &quot;tower&quot; section.">closer to the end</a>, pull out your full party and take a couple battles to get Brey the EXP he needs.  If you did the Metal Slime grind in Chapter Two, you'll need up to 3.4k EXP, otherwise you'll need up to 6.1k.  These numbers assume all Demighouls and Anderougs in the boss gauntlet get bounced with the Aeolus Shield, not killed by Defeat.  If you did the Metal Slime grind, you can opt to kill the Anderougs instead of hitting them with the Aeolus Shield (or at least wait until three die before using the shield).<br>
			<br>
			You can optionally pick up the Water Flying Clothes for Brey, but he shouldn't need them.  Grab the Mirror Shield in the center of the tower section and equip it on Ragnar.  This will give you a slight damage boost against Radimvice, which is nice if you play the fight overly safely, and also gives you a chance of murdering Metal Kings and Babbles in the remainder of the dungeon.  Another option is to grab the Demon Mail (The chest you pass in the "arrow room") for Ragnar, which will provide resistance to almost all spells (not Infermost) on top of the Dragon Mail's breath resist.

The former is fewer steps, but the latter gives you a second Sword of Miracles for the Gigademon fight.  This guide will encourage starting with the Infurnus Shadow.

				Before this fight, make sure Cristo is in your party and has the second Sword of Miracles equipped.  If Ragnar has the Mirror Shield and does NOT have the Demon Mail, I recommend unequipping his Dragon Mail so that the Mirror Shield's spell resistances activate.  Just don't forget to re-equip it after the fight...<br>
				<br>
				Start by putting your tactic on Defensive and casting Expel on the Demighouls.  Between Defeat's 40% chance to hit and Expel's 80% chance, this should clean up all three of them.  If it doesn't, depending on your team's health you can either cast Expel again, or start healing your team.<br>
				<br>
				The safe way to handle Radimvice is to cast Fendspell on your entire team.  I start with the character who has the <u>most</u> HP, so that Cristo doesn't attempt to heal them.  Alternatively, you can assume Cristo will go before the Hero and heal your Fendspell target, but keep in mind Radimvice is even faster than Cristo.  When it's the Hero's turn to be buffed, use the Zenithian Shield instead to cast Bounce.  Once Fendspell/Bounce are up on all living characters, you're practically unkillable.  Despite this being "the safe way", you will almost certainly lose a character or two, which really slows down the fight.  Attempting to pick up dead characters with Vivify isn't worth it since he'll likely just re-kill the character immediately, so just attack until Radimvice dies.<br>
				<br>
				The aggressive strat for Radimvice is just to attack him, and hope he goes to sleep.  Switch to Use No MP and swing away.  Once he falls asleep, heal Alena or Hero if they need it, but let Ragnar and Cristo heal themselves with their Swords of Miracles.  Don't bother removing his Bounce or using the Sword of Decimation, as he's very resistant to magic.

				Before entering the castle, go to Rosaville and sell Ragnar's Sword of Miracles to buy him a Sword of Lethargy, and equip it.  You should have some junk equipment still if you can't quite afford it.  Throw the Aeolus Shield into the wagon and make sure the Hero has the Sword of Decimation, Leaf of the World Tree, and Dew of the World Tree.  Your party order should be Ragnar, Alena, Hero, and Cristo.  Make sure one of them has the Baron's Horn.  Heal and save either in <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Soretta is faster if you don't want to save, Last Refuge is faster if you do.  You really don't need to save; Hero should have Vivify, and if he doesn't you can pay to revive Cristo."></a>Soretta or the Last Refuge</a>.<br>
				<br>
				If you don't have the Hat of Happiness, you can optionally try walking through Necrosaro's Castle with just Hero and Ragnar.  You'll spend less MP healing, but there's slightly a higher risk of needing to use Vivify to pick someone up.  But as long as Cristo and Hero both get to Necrosaro with about 50 MP, you should be fine.<br>
				<br>
				Walk to Necrosaro.  If you get caught by the Clay Dolls, you can either attack them and hope they go to sleep, or cast Sleepmore on them.  They can cast Defeat, so be ready to reset if they kill off Cristo or too many other party members.  The random encounters shouldn't be an issue in here as long as you keep your health high.<br>
				<br>
				Once you get through the castle, use the Baron's Horn, and then enter the mountain.  The final battle will begin when you step adjacent to Necrosaro, so stop one tile early and do the final preparations.  Double-check that the Hero's inventory matches the above, and that Hero and Ragnar both have Swords of Lethargy equipped.  Re-order to Ragnar -> Alena -> Hero -> Cristo.

				Round one, change your tactics to Defensive and cast Fendspell on Necrosaro.  This will stop Cristo from casting Defeat/Surround and stop Brey from casting Icebolt.  Starting turn two, use the Sword of Decimation once (aggressive) or put him to sleep by attacking with the Sword of Lethargy first (safer).  If Ragnar or Alena have too much defense power (if you didn't throw away enough armor, or if Alena simply has too much agility) Cristo will cast Upper instead of a second Increase.  If this happens, give up on the second Increase and move on.  Cristo will probably outrun the hero and cast Beat turn one, but Cristo may open with Increase if he outruns the Hero, or if you've died to Necrosaro once Cristo learned Beat doesn't work during the first attempt.

				On the turn Cristo will cast his second Increase, swap Alena for Nara (should happen after Cristo's turn using Nara's agility), and then swap Cristo for Brey.  Once Necrosaro's defense is lowered and he reaches a certain HP threshhold, Brey should start casting Bikill.  Bring Alena back in after he casts it on the other two.  He'll usually cast Bikill on the character with the most attack power first (Ragnar).<br>
				<br>
				It's most important that Bikill gets cast on Ragnar, since Bikill stops Alena from getting critical hits, but ideally Brey casts it on all three characters before Necrosaro goes into phase two.  If Necrosaro transforms before you're set up, you'll either need to cast Fendspell on him again, or just go without it.  Personally, as long as Ragnar has it, I just push forward.  Alena's crits will mitigate the damage loss, and Hero can cast Zap when Necrosaro is asleep to boost his own damage.<br>

				After your setup is done, phases one and two are pretty free.  Don't bother lowering his defense power on phases 2-3.  The Sword of Decimation only works on these phases 40% of the time, and you'll do enough damage with Bikill that it's not worth losing a turn to a failed Defense.   Phase 3 is obnoxious, but does very low damage.  Remember that the Hero has the Awake spell in case Phase 3's Sweet Breath catches more than one of your team.<br>
				<br>
				Once his head falls off and you enter Phase 4, you need to start being careful.  Phase 4 attacks on a pattern and uses the Freezing Waves ability every six turns, despite Phase 4 not having fingertips.  Your options for avoiding Freezing Waves are:<br>
				1) Count his actions from the start of the fight.  He'll use Freezing Waves on action 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, etc.<br>
				2) Cast Ironize once the phase begins.  If you don't see him use Waves during Ironize, it'll happen after Violent Blaze (Keep in mind he'll attack instead of meditating if he's at full HP).<br>
				3) Just go for it and cast Ironize after Violent Blaze.<br>
				You also get a free round at the start of Phase 4 when his belly opens up, so if you put him to sleep you likely don't have to worry about Waves at all.<br>
				<br>
				Starting in Phase 4, you want to keep a priority on keeping Necrosaro asleep, but go back to lowering his defense once he's down.  If you think Alena's attacks will kill Phases 4-6, remove her from the team so that Hero or Ragnar push him into the next phase instead.  Their Sword of Lethargy procs will put him to sleep <i>after</i> the transformation occurs.  This is vital for the final phase, but still helps speed through his other phases.<br>
				<br>
				You'll also want to keep Alena out of the fight during phases five and six just to protect her.  Lucia, you can either keep in or take out.  I generally leave her in to cast HealAll and Defense while Hero and Ragnar work on getting him back to sleep.  If Lucia dies, you can pull Cristo in, but try to keep him out of the fight when Necrosaro is awake.  You can swap Alena for a corpse to protect Lucia instead of just removing her from the group, but keep in mind Necrosaro (and Lucia) will get a turn before the swap occurs.<br>
				<br>
				When you reach the final phase, hopefully he immediately goes to sleep.  If so, pull Alena in, use the Sword of Decimation, and start pouring on damage.  Swap Lucia for Cristo so that she doesn't Bounce Defense onto herself.  If he doesn't fall asleep, or if he wakes up before the Sword of Decimation procs, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Three casts gives Ragnar an 80% chance of learning he's immune to Sleepmore.  A fourth cast gets you up to 90%.">cast Ironize 3-4 times to teach Ragnar</a> to attack instead of using the Sword of Lethargy to cast Sleepmore, and hide Alena until his defense is lowered.  The final phase will use Freezing Waves frequently to remove your buffs, but it's much better than seeing his ice breath.  If you get him to sleep and you've done a little damage to him, swap Cristo for Brey to get Bikill back up.  The final phase regenerates a hundred HP per turn, so the more damage you output the harder you'll push past his regen to finish the fight.<br>

				This guide has a solid focus on detailing the route a runner would take through the game to beat the game as fast as viably possible, but there are many things you should do differently in your first runs, or in situations where you want to complete a full run without restarting the game.  The guide above mentions many of these compromises as they come up, but this appendix will highlight the big ones.

				In general, grinding out more experience points is safer.  There are many places you can get an extra level or two to help your odds of beating the next boss(es) without spending so much time that you could've just fought the boss a few extra times instead.<br>
				<br>
				Chapter One:  If you have low HP (less than 45) at level six, it's not a bad idea to get up to level seven before fighting Saro's Shadow.  It'll cost you less than two minutes, but a trip back to the boss is usually about three.  Normally I'll just fight the boss at level six no matter what, and if I die to him once I'll get level seven as I walk back to him.<br>
				<br>
				Chapter Two:  This one is also stat-dependent, but if you have <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Under 80 HP and/or under 42 strength. Being under on both gives you a 15-30% chance to win the tournament.">below average stats</a> on Alena at level 11, you'll want to get her to level twelve.  This can mean killing another Metal Slime, or fighting more trash outside Endor.  If you were farming Metal Slimes, you can Return to the Bazaar and fight out there until Brey hits 11 and learns Snowstorm, and then go back to Endor.<br>
				<br>
				Chapter Five:  In early runs, I would strongly encourage runners to get extra levels out of the Metal Babble grind.  At minimum you need the Hero to learn Zap, but one more level on Cristo gets you HealAll, another level on Hero gets you a second HealAll, and a second level on Cristo gets you Vivify.  Each extra Metal Babble you kill should net you one of the above bonuses, in the listed order.

			<div class="alt-strat">
				If you're not pushing to set a new world record, it's a good idea to grind on Birdsong/Endor enemies in Chapter Two instead of Metal Slimes.  The Metal Slime grind is extremely unreliable, and under half of your Metal Slime grinds will end up faster than the alternative.  I would only recommend using the Metal Slime grind to someone who has a sub seven hour personal best.<br>
				<br>
				When you do this alternate grind, you can also consider saving right before Alena hits level 11 and resetting if she doesn't gain much strength.  She usually gains 2-5 strength, so resetting to ensure you get 4-5 could really increase your odds of a first try tournament win.  You can even check your stats at level 9 and consider doing the same savescumming for level 10 if you think you're low on strength or even HP.

				At the end of Chapter Three, you can fill up Taloon's inventory with Abacus of Virtue or Iron Aprons to sell in Chapter Five.  This will cost you about two minutes of menuing, more if you have to make a special trip to get more money just for this, but it'll let you buy more defense power for Ragnar and the Hero.  With this extra money, during the Rosaville shopping trips, you can buy Dragon Mail and Iron Helmets or Masks for both characters.

				TODO: I need a writeup on the glitches I know about
			</div>
			<div class="details">
				<h5>Dragon Warrior IV Glitches</h5>
				<br>
				All of the glitches below are allowed in DW4 RTAs, because none of them allow you to perform story sequence breaks.  This ruling will likely change and an additional RTA category may be created if major skips are ever found.<br>
				<br>
				<h6>"Repel Glitch"</h6>
				This bug isn't technically a flaw in how Repel works, but repelling enemies is how we apply it to the speedrun.<br>
				<br>
				Repel, Fairy Water, and <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I haven't confirmed this personally, but I'm told all of this applies to the monster arena as well.">the casino monster arena</a> operate based on your highest leveled party member.  However, instead of checking your whole party every time it needs to know the highest level, the game writes down the highest level into a memory address that isn't always updated.  I have <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It should be titled &quot;On Repel.txt&quot; somewhere in the DW4 Notes directory.">a file in my notes folder</a> with more details, but it basically updates after battle (unless you run), between chapters, and when you load the game, and it only considers members in the wagon if you have the wagon with you.  Additionally and more importantly, it recognizes <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="?-level characters like Healie">"guest" party members</a> as <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="If you look at my table of monster stats, these numbers are their index in that table.">levels 198-205</a>, so if you have a guest in your team (or haven't fought/reset since losing one) you can repel any enemy on the overworld.  As for the casino, I'm told it moduluses the party's level by 128, so technically it will only see you as level 70-77, but I'm not convinced the monster formations change when you're higher than that.<br>
				<br>
				<h6>"Coffin Blocking"</h6>
				This is a pretty tame glitch, but very useful in the speedrun.  Most enemies in this game have a higher chance when using basic physical attacks to target the character you put in the front of the party than the characters behind them.  However, there is a flaw in this targeting routine that makes these monsters ignore the backmost living character if there is a dead character somewhere in front of them.  For example, if your party order is Alena, Brey, Cristo, and Brey is dead, most monsters won't be able to target Cristo.  Some monsters (noted in my monster data chart) have "unweighted" targeting -- meaning they have an equal chance to strike each party member -- and that form of targeting does not have this flaw.  All spells use unweighted targeting as well, and area attacks will still hit all characters.<br>
				<br>
				<h6>Double-Door/Treasure Map Glitch</h6>
				Applications of this bug are disappointingly limited, but if you open the Treasure Map in a town with the large sets of double-doors (Rosaville, most castles) the doors will close.  Not a big deal, except that these doors act strangely when you open them from above or from the sides, which you can do if you exit such a building and then use the map while still standing on the door.  I haven't studied the exact behavior, but opening these doors from other directions will spawn a new door, offset by one or two tiles based on which direction you're facing, and <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="In fact, all double-doors on the map will open at the same time.  The game never has multiple sets of these doors on one map, except in Stancia where they all default to open.">they'll both open</a>.  You can always stand on the lower two tiles of these doors, so being able to spawn more doors allows you to get <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Out of the intended boundaries, rather.  You will still exit the town if you walk too far away, and if you spawn a door outside of the town limits, the game will crash.">out of bounds</a> in some areas.<br>
				<br>
				There are only a couple of uses for this, and none of them benefit the speedrun.  The closest is that you can get the Multi-Edge Sword in Endor before getting the magic key, but the magic key is available as soon as the Treasure Map is available, so that's not too useful.<br>
				<br>
				The most interesting use is that you can talk to an out-of-bounds NPC in the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="You can actually see his feet without going out of bounds.">top-right corner of Endor</a>, but he just repeats something originally said by an NPC in the bazaar in chapter two.<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, you can use this to break out of Zenithia after beating Necrosaro without triggering the end sequence (jump in the hole to the Final Cave and die to the clay dolls in Necrosaro's castle), which lets you visit some towns when they're set up for the ending cutscenes.  There's also something screwy you can do in the Final Cave to glitch the overworld and wrong warp to the Shrine of Breaking Waves (which gets you stuck surrounded by water and mountains without the ship), but I don't know the specifics of it.  There's a video of someone doing this one on the Famicom version, and I messed with it a little and believe it works the same way on NES, but don't remember the steps to reproduce it.  The Famicom version can skip the barrier/minibosses before Necrosaro by jumping out of the Final Cave on a specific tile, but this doesn't work on NES because an out-of-bounds memory pointer isn't pointing at the same memory addresses.<br>
				<br>
				<h6>Walk Around as Ghosts</h6>
				As long as the second character in your party is a living character who isn't the Hero and isn't carrying key items (Magic Key, Magma Staff, likely others), Gardenbur will throw that character in jail even if the rest of your team is dead or otherwise uncontrollable.  This can lead to you having a team that's all ghosts and/or Panon and still being able to walk around.  Note that there are a lot of actions from this state that can trigger the game to check who's in your party and, if you're somewhere without access to the wagon, cause softlocks, including re-ordering the party, casting spells, and using items.<br>
				<br>
				If you walk out to the world map, you can get into battle, but after one round you'll trigger a wipe.  If Panon is alive, you can attempt to run, but exiting the battle makes the game acknowledge that you shouldn't be able to walk around, and if you can't access the wagon you'll softlock.  If Panon is the only character in your party, you should always run away first try, so it's unfortunate that you can't continue after the battle ends...<br>
				<br>
				<h6>Gardenbur at Night</h6>
				Gardenbur is normally inaccessible at night, but if you save at Gardenbur, save again at the Last Refuge during night time, and reset the game, you will start at Gardenbur during the night.  The castle's "night time map" has no NPCs on it other than the guards blocking the front door, so there's not a whole lot you can do in here.<br>
				<br>
				<h5>Dragon Quest IV (Famicom) Glitches</h5>
				<br>
				Some glitches were fixed when they ported DQ4 to the NES, but as far as I know, no new bugs were introduced.  Standard DQ4 FC "bug limit" runs ban three of the glitches below, but there's a separate category with a few times on its board where anything goes.<br>
				<br>
				<h6>Holy Water Bug</h6>
				When you use Holy Water (Fairy Water) on an enemy in DQ4/DW4, it deals about ten points of damage.  In the North American release it uses the Expel resistance value, but in the Japanese release it will work on all enemies every time, including Metal Slimes.  This glitch is notably allowed in standard DQ4 FC "bug limit" RTAs.<br>
				<br>
				<h6>Invisible Balloon Gltich (Banned)</h6>
				Before turning in the Gas Canister, there's a balloon sitting, invisible, in the corner of the map at coordinate 0,0.  You can find it by sailing <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Give or take one or two in either direction based on how you interpret my bad description of the initial position.">three tiles north and fourteen tiles west</a> after getting the NW corner of Stancia island in the bottom-right corner of your screen.  The balloon returns to the corner of the map when you enter a town, so it's not useful for general travel, but you can use it to sequence break to Gardenbur, the World Tree, and Gottside.<br>
				<br>
				<h6>"8x Run Glitch" (Banned)</h6>
				When you fail to run more than three times, which can only happen in boss fights, the counter that tracks your run fails overflows and starts setting other combat flags.  The fourth failure will set the flag that determines whether or not you've used the Sandglass of Regression <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I'm not entirely sure why this flag exists.  It tracks whether you've used it since the last inn stay, which determines whether or not the sandglass is usable, elsewhere.">during the current battle</a>, and the eighth will set a flag used by the Chance spell that causes all of your attacks to be critical hits.  This means if you fail to run eight times, or <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Note that using the Sandglass SETS the bit, it's not an increment, so it won't carry over if it's already set.  This means if you run four times before using the sandglass, using it will not help you get to the crit flag faster.  I recommend running three times, using the Sandglass, and then running again.  Also note that the Sandglass has to actually work, so if you used it in another battle since your last inn stay, it will not help you.  However, even though the Sandglass resets the battle, it doesn't reset your run count.">use the Sandglass</a> and fail to run four times, you will get critical hits for the rest of the battle.  Since running eight times will also require a few recovery turns, and battles don't generally last 8-12 rounds, I've only found this to be useful against Necrosaro or to salvage a really bad Radimvice fight, but if you pick up the sandglass it might be useful against other slow fights like Bakor or the Gigademon.  I've also seen it used on Linguar, but that's really just bad luck protection.<br>
				<br>
				<h6>Casino Coin Price Overflow (Banned)</h6>
				When you purchase more than <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This is the highest value that can be stored in three bytes of data: 256^3, or 2^24.">16,777,216 gold</a> worth of coins, the price underflows and you'll only have to pay the modulus of the expected amount and 16,777,216.  This means in chapter five where coins cost 20 gold, if you buy 838,861 coins, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="838861 * 20 - 16777216 = 4">the price will overflow</a> and you'll only be charged four gold.  In chapter three, coins cost 200 gold, so you could buy 83,887 coins and only have to pay 184 gold.  Since you can't buy more than 999,999 coins at once, you can't perform this glitch in chapter two, where coins only cost 10 gold.

				<h6>In chronological order,</h6><br>
				Thanks to my mother for helping me get through the original Dragon Warrior when I was like four years old.  The four year olds I've met during my adulthood have made this achievement feel particularly impressive.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks to all of the buddies I made playing Dragon Warrior themed fangames in the early 00's, most of whom I still talk to on a daily basis.  They're the main reason this run means enough to me to stick with it this long.<br>
				<br>
				On that note, thanks to the buddies I've made more recently playing and watching these games (and others) on Twitch.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks to NESCardinality for providing the initial inspiration to speedrun such a long video game, as well as the VOD I based my original route on (<a href="https://www.speedrun.com/dw4/run/8y813xwz" target="_blank">his 6:40 run from 03/14/2015</a>).<br>
				<br>
				Thanks to Everhate for assisting with my early runs of both Dragon Warrior IV and Dragon Warrior III, and (to my knowledge) for coming up with the original NES speedrun route for the game, based on Japanese Famicom runs.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks to EvilAsh25 for digging up some useful Japanese-language docs detailing how things work in DQ4 FC, for helping parse Google Translated versions of those docs, for his own independent research and scripting, and for assistance in re-routing chapter five in 2018.<br>
				<br>
				And, of course, thanks to Linguar for inventing 25%.
